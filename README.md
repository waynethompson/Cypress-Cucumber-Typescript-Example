## Building documentation with pickles

This will only work on windows at the moment because it requires .net 4.5, however this is likely to change in the future.

install pickes with chocolatey first (you will need to install chockolatey for that to work)
https://chocolatey.org/packages/pickles

Run with
```
npm run docs
```
 view the html in the ./documentation folder.
